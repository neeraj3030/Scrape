# WEB SCRAPING  with beautiful soup & requests


## Purpose : 

I often download movies via some index links. After a plethora of site links , i finally got one which contain nearly every
movie links. 
I wanted to avoid consistent repeated task of visiting that link and searching for a specific movie link.

This is where Scraping comes handy.

Scrape through the webpage using beautiful soup & requests in python

get all the movie links & store them in a pickle (intermediate file )  & then ultimately to a CSV file.

>NOTES : Main working code is [movie.ipynb]() ,
>   To view notebook files use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) 
>>   frugy.ipynb  is another mini scraping code unreletable to the above 'movie link scraper'. It is my current project aimed to scrape for a product across different ecom sites at cheapest affordable price.
>>> ALL CODE IS SELF-EXPLANATORY ... still submit pull request for any changes or doubts
